# About this project
A NodeJS Server for application called "Quizone" - my final-year's project.

# About Quizone
Quizone is a website allows users to host, and play a game with a quiz with some utilities.
## Demo
I researched so long but still can not find a way to deploy this server to the internet. The only available hosting platform I've found is Heroku,
but it's no longer completely free and requires a credit card to deploy, but unfortunately, I don't have it.

If you want to run this project, please clone it, then run `npm i`, and `npm start` to run.

Then you can go to this link to see the UI: https://quizzer-fe.vercel.app/. This is the UI created by my team member - Danh Tran.

You can see his GitHub project here: https://github.com/d4nhtr4n/quizone-fe.

This website will call API from the server you cloned and started at localhost.
You can also see video demo here: [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C1_EXsxBFP8TtjpvxW4SGS_E6Y8b4oEe/view?usp=sharing)
## Notice
This project is using new language and technology to me. Some bugs need to fix,
and system performance is terrible, so just don't use it as a preference.

Maybe I will improve this project someday.

# Main functionalities:
## Host
- Users can create a quiz with various questions, with two types available: Multiple choice or True/False. They can also add a theme, thumbnail for the
quiz, and image for each question.
- Users can create a room that players can join using a PIN code. Host can also kick and block a player from joining the game, or mix the questions with
random orders.
- Users can see a report about the game that has finished. A report includes content of the question, max point, and answers of all players.
## Play
